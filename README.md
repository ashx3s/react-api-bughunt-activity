# React API Fetch Bughunt

This code is based on the React API challenges code and has broken examples of some of the challenges proposed in the other codebase. However these include syntax and logic errors that you'll need to debug

## Debugging Challenges

## Styling Notes

- Tailwind and the prettier plugin for tailwind have been already set up (your tailwind classes will auto sort when you run the format command)
